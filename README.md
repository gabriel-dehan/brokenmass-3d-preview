# Brokenmass Blueprint 3D Previewer

## Usage

* `yarn start` to run eslint on watch mode and dev-server at localhost:8080.
* `yarn build` to generate a minified, production-ready build.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Only load needed recipe icons
- [ ] Belts are sometimes not rendered properly, for instance: https://www.dysonsphereblueprints.com/blueprints/research-bottle has a hole
- [ ] Improve mouseover so it doesn't trigger multiple times on the same object
